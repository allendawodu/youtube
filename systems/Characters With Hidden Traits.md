###### _An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge_Â by Ambrose Bierce
The man who was engaged in being hanged was apparently about thirty-five years of age.

He was a civilian, if one might judge from his habit, which was that of a planter.

His features were good--a straight nose, firm mouth, broad forehead, from which his long, dark hair was combed straight back, falling behind his ears to the collar of his well fitting frock coat. He wore a mustache and pointed beard, but no whiskers; his eyes were large and dark gray, and had a kindly expression which one would hardly have expected in one whose neck was in the hemp.

Evidently this was no vulgar assassin.

This system has three steps: Mislead -> Justify -> Truth

To use this system, there needs to a hidden trait that can't be known just by looking at the character. In fact, this system can also be used for environments (e.g., initially describing a funeral as if its a party).

Mislead, the first step in this system is to implant into the reader a false idea of the character based off their looks or mannerisms. Do not outright say that the character is X, suggest it.

Justify, use the outward appearance of the character to justify why the reader should believe the character is the way that was suggested in the Mislead phase. This will be the longest phase.

Truth, everything said previously is the truth, but this is where you reveal an unexpected trait about the character. Use one sentence. It should contrast boldly with the last two phases.
