###### Overview
The concept of situational irony comes down to a moment where a character, usually at the very end of the story (sometimes implied), realizes that they did something (often with a big sacrifice) that they didn't have to do.
###### When
Such a situation arises as a result of a lack of communication and poverty, not necessarily in money, but in a medium of exchange of any type (e.g., love).

The characters put themselves in these situations usually as a result of desperateness, which leads to their sacrifice. This desperateness usually comes from a place of love and/or respect for the person they're sacrificing for.

Use this system...
- When you want to show what a character is willing to sacrifice for another character in a humorous, yet sad, way
	- Naturally attuned to short stories
- When you want to put a character in a bad situation as a result of a lack of communication
	- Naturally attuned to the start of a longer story
###### Character Response
When the characters realize the irony, there's a sense of, "Oh."

Natural responses to such situations can include...
- Self-soothing Laughter
- Pity from other characters
- An increased sense of respect from other characters
- A feeling of worthlessness or having wasted time/energy
###### Reader's Response
This is a retable feeling for the reader, they can recall a time in their life where they did something for someone (with a lot of effort included) just to find that they didn't need to or that there was a much easier way to achieve the same result.

Reading this, the reader may feel a sense of, "Dang...that sucks," or maybe a little bit of humor at the situation, depending on the lightness of the mood and degree of sacrifice between the characters.
###### System
- Why are you using this system?
	- I provided two suggested times to use this system, choose one or make up your own.
- What does the character lack?
	- What is poverty to them? Remember, it doesn't have to be money.
- Why are they so desperate?
	- What displays of love, respect, or help did the other character show to make this character so desperate?
	- What is this character's *why* for wanting to pay back their debts?
- What are they willing to sacrifice?
	- What is something that character has that they can give up to pay off their debt?
- Why was their sacrifice for naught?
