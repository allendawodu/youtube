###### *Bullet in the Brain* by Tobias Wolff
Anders burst out laughing. He covered his mouth with both hands and, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry," then snorted helplessly through his fingers and said, "*Capeesh*, oh, God, *capeesh*," and at that the man with the pistol raised the pistol and shot Anders right in the head.

The bullet smashed Anders' skull and plowed through his brain and exited behind his right ear, scattering shards of bone into the cerebral cortex, the corpus callosum, back toward the basal ganglia, and down into the thalamus. But before all this occurred, the first appearance of the bullet in the cerebrum set off a crackling chain of ion transports and neurotransmissions. Because of their peculiar origin, these traced a peculiar pattern, flukishly calling to life a summer afternoon some forty years past, and long since lost to memory. After striking the cranium, the bullet was moving at nine hundred feet per second, a pathetically sluggish, glacial pace compared with the synaptic lightning that flashed around it. Once in the brain, that is, the bullet came under the mediation of brain time, which gave Anders plenty of leisure to contemplate the scene that, in a phrase he would have abhorred, "passed before his eyes."

Overview → Detailed → Flashback + Time Descriptors

Wolff describes the same scene thrice over, going into even more detail with every round.

Overview, a simple statement of what occurred.

Detailed, a sequential series of statements of what occurred.

Flashback, the transition statement that moves the clock hand back to the start of the event.

Time Descriptors, an even more detailed sequential series of what occurred, now taking advantage of time descriptors to emphasize the slowing down of time.
